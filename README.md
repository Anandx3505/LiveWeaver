# LiveWeaver – Online Code Editor

LiveWeaver is a simple, browser-based code editor that lets users write, preview, and manage HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects in real time. Designed to deliver an online coding experience similar to an IDE, LiveWeaver supports features such as live preview, project saving, file editing, and shortcut-based saving.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Firebase Authentication (Sign up / Login)
- 💾 Project file storage using Supabase
- 🖊️ Tab-based code editor for HTML, CSS, and JS files
- 🔄 Real-time live preview
- 💡 Ctrl+S / Cmd+S shortcut to save code
- 📁 Project listing and creation dashboard

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Firebase (Authentication)
- Supabase (Storage & File Management)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Auth:** User signs up or logs in using Firebase.
2. **Project Initialization:** A default welcome project is created (only once).
3. **Dashboard:** Projects are listed using Supabase folder structure.
4. **Editor:** Code is loaded into the editor. Users can write and preview HTML, CSS, and JS.
5. **Save:** Pressing `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` uploads code to Supabase storage.



## 📌 Future Improvements
